Figma link attached. The .fig project displays the current prototype idea for the application.
Since the application uses a third party map library, we developed a demo application that implements said map.
roadwatch_map_demo is a crude demo of the mapview and how it may ne implemented in the final program.
NOTE! This demo app is only for demonstrating the implementation of the map feature. Rest of the functionalities are
in the Figma project

Build guides for demo app:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open roadwatch_map_demo in IntellJ IDEA or some other IDE.
3. Make sure you are using JDK 18->
4. Run the HelloApplication.java file
5. Should work ;)
